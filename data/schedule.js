I started off at UCI as a computer science major (when IC21 was the intro course. I’m that old.) , but coding wasn’t really for me. I was more interested in the work I was doing as a graphic designer at the bookstore. I eventually switched into informatics and the rest is history.<br/><img src=\"/data/imgs/nathaniel-valerio.png\" class=\"portrait\"><br/>Hi I’m Nathaniel Valerio, a Product Designer currently at Mixpanel. I previously worked as a designer on Firebase as well as many other different industries. I am a self taught designer, who like Vinson, at UCI, saw coding was not my cup of tea and thus took up Informatics. I was inspired to enter the creative world from my time as a dancer."
