                    Hello! I am here at Design at UCI for (most likely) the same reasons you are reading this and checking out this organization: to be a part of a design community at UCIrvine and grow as a designer. My interests span from technology to design and even to psychology. With these interests in mind, I decided to study Informatics and specialize in Human-Computer Interaction. I got my early start designing spreads for my high school yearbook, but little did I know how design can be a means of problem-solving and not just about making things visually appealing (well, that’s another big part of it). After digging around and learning more about the different design disciplines, I have found an interest in the world of UI/UX and product design. While I would have loved to have a design-oriented organization and community on campus during my first few years of college, there wasn’t. Hopefully, Design at UCI will be that community for you and all who are interested in design, and I am excited to be a part of a team dedicated to creating exactly that.
                    <span class="label">Creative Type</span>
                    According to Adobe, my creative type is the “Dreamer”, whose creative strengths include “connections to emotions and imagination, empathy and sensitivity”—which I definitely all resonate with. I’m a daydreamer at heart and I lean more on the idealistic side. I hope to let my imagination and empathy be driving forces in how I design.

                    I’m a fourth year Computer Science major, but I’m interested in doing Graphic Design. I became involved in Design at UCI because I like seeing the skills and talent of other designers, and want to be in a community where I can help others discover their potential.
                    <span class="label">Creative Type</span>
                    My creative type is a Dreamer, and I resonate with this because “I really like creating things, but I usually don't plan them, so when I design I often do it in the moment, rather than prior planning."

                        I’m a second year - I’m currently undeclared, but I plan on transferring into Informatics with a specialization in Human Computer Interaction. I’m also minoring in Psychological Science so that I can get a better understanding of behavior and the mind. I feel like that’ll compliment well as I plan to pursue User Interface Design. My interest in UI Design stems from doing a little bit of Graphic Design when I Was younger and the idea that it combines technology and art, two of my interests, into one field. While in Design at UCI, I hope to learn more about the skills and tools I’ll need to be successful in the industry. I’m also looking forward to cultivating a community for designers at UCI for years to come.
                        <span class="label">Creative Type</span>
                    I’m a Dreamer and I find that this resonates well with me because I am “deeply emotional and intuitive, with a vivid imagination” and I am “happy to roam your mental landscape of thoughts, emotions, and fantasies for hours on end”.

                    I’m a Computer Science major going into my second year. My design interest is in the fields of Graphic, Motion, and UX design. I got involved in Design at UCI because I love to digital design and try to find time to do it everyday. In addition to having fun during the process of making something, the satisfaction from creating something beautiful and improving it is always extremely rewarding. Discussing design with others and seeing how they interpret something into a design also interests me a lot.
                    <span class="label">Creative Type</span>
                    I am an Artist because I am “driven by the desire to express [myself] and transform the world around [me] " and "with [my] love of beauty and [my] connection to the senses, [I] have a strong aesthetic orientation and [I] crave well-designed environments.”

                    I’m a third year Psychological Science major. My design interest is in UI/UX design. I got involved in Design because I wanted to create a space for people who were interested in Design to come. It doesn’t matter the level of experience, because we’re all here to learn and grow our design skills and hopefully make some new friends along the way.
                    <span class="label">Creative Type</span>
                    My creative type is the Visionary. I resonate with this creative type, because I feel like when I have an idea, it can sprout into many variations. I also feel like when this happens, I might be so excited by all my ideas that it’s hard to start executing them. I also resonate with the creative type because I “love sharing [my] ideas and visions with others and creating [a] community around shared values and ideals”.

                    I’m a third year Business Economics major pursuing the Digital Information Systems minor, which was what sparked my interest in design and UX/UI. I’m not as familiar and educated in this field as my fellow board members, but I am here to learn from this community! I really like the creative outlet aspect of design and the logic hybrid in UX/UI. 
                    <span class="label">Ceative Type</span>
                    I’m a Visionary which I found a bit surprising. I can understand this because I am “emotional, passion-driven, and full of ideas” which fuels my primary drive.

                    I’m a fourth year, double majoring in Informatics and Cognitive Sciences. My interest in design is related to User Experience and/or Product Design. I like design because it fits right at the intersection of science and art, a point that I thrive in. It allows me to be analytical and creative at the same time, and apply my interests in tech, people, and art all together. Design pushes me to push my boundaries, problem solve, learn, create and tell a story. I love being a part of Design at UCI because I get to interact and learn from like-minded folks who have a multitude of perspectives and approach to design. As Industry Outreach Coordinator, I get in touch with industry professionals who can bring diversity of thought and insightful experiences to inspire student designers at UCI.
